BMI Calculator

Description of the python program

Procedural Programming Paradigm:

Step 1: Import the Tkinter module
•	This imports the Tkinter module, which is the standard GUI toolkit for Python.

Step 2: Define the 'calculate_bmi' function
•	This function is called when the "Calculate BMI" button is pressed.
•	It attempts to convert the user-entered weight and height to floats and calculates the BMI.
•	Updates the 'result_label' with the calculated BMI and a green color.
•	Based on the BMI value, it updates the 'feedback_label' with a corresponding message and color.

Step 3: Create the main Tkinter window
•	Creates the main window for the BMI Calculator application.
•	Sets the title of the window to "BMI Calculator".

Step 4: Create and place widgets in the window
•	Creates labels, entry widgets, and a button for weight, height, and the "Calculate BMI" button.
•	Configures the layout of these widgets using the 'grid' geometry manager.
•	Initializes 'result_label' and 'feedback_label' with empty text and black color.

Step 5: Start the main event loop
•	Enters the Tkinter event loop, allowing the application to respond to user interactions.

In summary, this code creates a simple BMI calculator GUI using Tkinter. 
Users can input their weight and height, press the "Calculate BMI" button, and receive feedback on their BMI category along with additional information. 
The GUI is structured using labels, entry widgets, and buttons, and the logic is encapsulated in the 'calculate_bmi' function.


Object Oriented Approach:

Step 1: Import the Tkinter module
•	Imports the Tkinter module, which provides tools for creating graphical user interfaces.

Step 2: Define the 'BMI_Calculator' class
•	Defines a class named 'BMI_Calculator'.
•	The '__init__' method is the class constructor. 
  It initializes the class instance with the main Tkinter window ('root'), sets the window title to "BMI Calculator", and calls the 'create_widgets' method.

Step 3: Create widgets within the 'create_widgets' method
•	'tk.Label' creates labels for "Weight" and "Height."
•	'tk.Entry' creates entry widgets for users to input their weight and height.
•	'tk.Button' creates a button labeled "Calculate BMI" with the 'command' parameter set to the 'calculate_bmi' method.
•	'tk.Label' creates labels for displaying the result and feedback, initialized with empty text and black color.
•	Widgets are placed in the window using the 'grid' geometry manager.

Step 4: Define the 'calculate_bmi' method
•	Converts user-inputted weight and height to floats, calculates BMI, and updates the 'result_label' with the result in green color.
•	Creates an instance of 'BMI_FeedbackGenerator' to get feedback and updates the 'feedback_label' with the corresponding message and color.
•	Handles 'ValueError' in case of invalid input and updates labels accordingly.

Step 5: Define the 'BMI_FeedbackGenerator' class
•	Defines a class named 'BMI_FeedbackGenerator' responsible for determining feedback messages and text colors based on BMI categories.

Step 6: Application entry point:
•	Checks if the script is being run as the main program.
•	Creates an instance of 'tk.Tk()' to initialize the Tkinter main window.
•	Creates an instance of 'BMI_Calculator', which in turn initializes the GUI elements.
•	Starts the Tkinter event loop with 'root.mainloop()' to make the application interactive.

In summary, this code defines a BMI calculator using Tkinter with a class-based approach, where each aspect of the application 
(GUI, calculations, feedback generation) is encapsulated in separate classes or methods, making the code more organized and modular. 
The Tkinter library is used for creating the graphical user interface, and the application provides feedback based on the calculated BMI.
